# BOTN Backup ~ Restore

I was inspired to create this tool to make backing up and restoring SaveGames and CharacterPresets easier. Instead of opening multiple folders and windows just to extract files from ZIP archives, this tool simplifies the entire process. The idea came from repeatedly seeing people in the Discord server ask, “Where is the SaveGames path?”—so I wanted to build something that reduces confusion and requires minimal user interaction.
